# nin_guide

A new Flutter project.

## Natur i Norge (NiN) Guide

App for mapping and identifying nature types in Norway.

## Landing Page, Web App & Privacy Policy

The project includes a landing page and privacy policy in the `docs/` directory. The Flutter web build is published under `docs/app/`.

GitHub Pages is configured to serve from **`main` / `docs`**. The landing page is at:

`https://geco-nhm.github.io/natur-i-norge/`

The **live** web app is at:

`https://geco-nhm.github.io/natur-i-norge/app/`

The frozen **NiN 2.3** archive (when synced) is at:

`https://geco-nhm.github.io/natur-i-norge/v2.3/`

### Build and deploy the web app

```bash
# Build only (output in docs/app/)
./publish.sh web

# Build, commit, and push to GitHub Pages
./publish.sh web --deploy

# Preview locally before deploying (mirrors GitHub Pages URL paths)
./scripts/preview_web.sh
# open http://localhost:8080/natur-i-norge/app/
```

To publish mobile stores and build web in one go:

```bash
./publish.sh all --deploy
```

### Firebase Storage CORS (required for web photos)

The web app loads observation images from Firebase Storage. Browsers block those
requests unless the storage bucket allows your site's origin.

One-time setup (requires [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) and access to the `natur-i-norge-guide` project):

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project natur-i-norge-guide
chmod +x scripts/configure_storage_cors.sh
./scripts/configure_storage_cors.sh
```

This applies `firebase/storage-cors.json`, allowing GitHub Pages and local preview.
Changes usually take effect within a few minutes.

If you develop with `flutter run -d chrome` on a different port, add that origin to
`firebase/storage-cors.json` and re-run the script.

Also ensure **Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains**
includes `geco-nhm.github.io` and `localhost`.

## Legacy web (v2.3, for posterity)

1. Copy prod `web/` → [`archive/v2.3-web/web/`](archive/v2.3-web/web/)
2. Publish to GitHub Pages:

```bash
./scripts/sync_legacy_web_to_docs.sh   # copies to docs/v2.3/ with correct paths
./publish.sh web --deploy              # or sync runs automatically if archive exists
```

The landing page links to the **live** app (`docs/app/`) and the **v2.3 archive** (`docs/v2.3/`). Preview the full site layout:

```bash
./scripts/preview_web.sh
# http://localhost:8080/natur-i-norge/  (landing + app + v2.3)
```

See [`archive/v2.3-web/README.md`](archive/v2.3-web/README.md) for details.
